\section{Probabilistic Model}
\label{sec:model}

In every subsection, motivate why this particular component is important/difficult and why we had to develop something new. Briefly relate to algorithmic details from relevant previous work.

\subsection{Spatial Compatibility}
\label{sec:spatialCompat}
Talk about spatial stuff here

\subsection{Color Compatibility}
\label{sec:colorCompat}
Talk about color stuff e.g. O'Donovan's model here.

\subsection{Weight Learning}
\label{sec:weights}
Learning weights is cool.

\subsection{Sampling}
\label{sec:sampling}
Which MH proposals do we use, etc.

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

Our prototype implementation of this model is written in the Scala programming language, using the Factorie toolkit for probabilistic modeling~\cite{Factorie}. To evaluate the color compatibility term, it uses the reference MATLAB implementation provided by O'Donovan et al.~\shortcite{ODonovan}. A link to the source code can be found on the project website.
