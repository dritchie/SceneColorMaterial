\section{Probabilistic Model}
\label{sec:model}

In every subsection, motivate why this particular component is important/difficult and why we had to develop something new. Briefly relate to algorithmic details from relevant previous work.

\subsection{Spatial Compatibility}
\label{sec:spatialCompat}
Talk about spatial stuff here

\subsection{Color Compatibility}
\label{sec:colorCompat}
Talk about color stuff e.g. O'Donovan's model here.

\subsection{Weight Learning}
\label{sec:weights}
Learning weights is cool.

\subsection{Sampling}
\label{sec:sampling}
Which MH proposals do we use, etc.

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
Short section. We use factorie, Scala, O'Donovan's MATLAB code, etc. Perhaps link to (a cleaned-up version of) the github repository, once it's ready?
