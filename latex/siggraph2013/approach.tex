\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\remark{D: Tom Funkhouser sold me on the value of this section, and one of the best examples from his papers is in http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~funk/pvg01.pdf. I actually like combining the Approach and Overview sections into one shorter section, though.}

Restate problem statement, why it's hard, and our approach (emphasizing the key idea)~\remark{Why it's hard: This might be the best place to show the results when we only use color compatibility, i.e. ``As a first approach, you might try using existing color compatibility models...'' and then show how that doesn't work, thus motivating the machinery we're about to describe.}

%Start of notes on pattern template terminology.






The (log linear) factor graph formalism (and any other persistent terminology).

Roadmap for the next section (which describes the technical details) / overview of the system.
