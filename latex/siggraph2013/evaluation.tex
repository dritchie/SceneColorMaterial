%Results from MTurk experiment

% Motivation for evaluation design
% May be more general aspects of aesthetics that our model captures, compared to random colorings or color compatibility only
We conducted an online judgement study to gain a better idea of how coloring suggestions from our model compare to ones from simpler models as well as ones from artists. We recruited 13 Computer Science graduate students to participate in the study. To better capture exploratory situations where our model would be used, we generate and present multiple coloring suggestions. Although different participants will have different aesthetic tastes, by looking across many participants, we should be able to see any general trends in the preferability of colorings generated by different methods. 

% Experiment Setup
We first generate a set of coloring suggestions from different sources -- artist colorings, our model, a color-compatibility-only model using the measure by O'Donovan et. al.~\shortcite{ODonovan}, and random colorings-- to be compared in the study. We picked 15 different pattern templates that do not have strong semantic associations and are also outside of our training set. Then, for each pattern template, we generated 4 coloring suggestions per source. For the artist source, we randomly picked 4 colorings from the top 45 artist colorings on COLOURlovers. For our model, we sampled colors using parallel tempering for 2000 iterations and picked the top 4 results using MMR with $\lambda = 0.5$. We similarly sample color-compatibility-only colorings. Finally, for the random source, we pick the first 4 random colorings.

The study interface presents participants with a randomized grid of suggestions for one pattern template at a time, for 6 pattern templates total out of the possible 15. Participants are asked to pick the 4 colorings they like the most and the 4 others like the least from the grid for one pattern template before moving on to the next template. The order of pattern templates is randomized. In addition, one template is presented twice, to check for participant consistency. 

%\remark{We need acknowledge that yes, different Turkers will have different aesthetic sensibilities--but averaging across many of them, we should be able to see any general trends in the preferability of colorings generated by different methods.}

% Experiment Analysis
%We ran repeated-measures ANOVA on the number of suggestions picked as ``favorite 4'' and ``least favorite 4'' from each source. The suggestion source was set as a fixed effect and pattern templates and participants were set as random effects. [Results pending]

Table ~\ref{table:study} shows the number of times suggestions from each source were chosen as a top 4 or bottom 4 pattern. When counting, we do not include suggestions from the replicated template. We use binomial regression to model the odds of each source being chosen--either as a top or bottom 4 suggestion. Tukey all-pair comparison tests show that all differences are significant ($p < 0.01$), except for the odds that an artist-created suggestion will be chosen as a bottom 4 suggestion versus a model-created suggestion. Artist-colored patterns are selected most often as a top 4 pattern, with our model-colored pattern selected second most often. In addition, model-colored patterns are selected least as a bottom 4 pattern along with artist-colored patterns.
