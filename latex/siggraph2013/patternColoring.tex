%%% The ``\documentclass'' command has one parameter, based on the kind of
%%% document you are preparing.
%%%
%%% [annual] - Technical paper accepted for presentation at the ACM SIGGRAPH 
%%%   or SIGGRAPH Asia annual conference.
%%% [sponsored] - Short or full-length technical paper accepted for 
%%%   presentation at an event sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH
%%%   (but not the annual conference Technical Papers program).
%%% [abstract] - A one-page abstract of your accepted content
%%%   (Technical Sketches, Posters, Emerging Technologies, etc.). 
%%%   Content greater than one page in length should use the "[sponsored]"
%%%   parameter.
%%% [preprint] - A preprint version of your final content.
%%% [review] - A technical paper submitted for review. Includes line
%%%   numbers and anonymization of author and affiliation information.

\documentclass[review]{acmsiggraph}

%%% If you are submitting your paper to one of our annual conferences - the 
%%% ACM SIGGRAPH conference held in North America, or the SIGGRAPH Asia 
%%% conference held in Southeast Asia - there are several commands you should 
%%% consider using in the preparation of your document.

%%% 1. ``\TOGonlineID''
%%% When you submit your paper for review, please use the ``\TOGonlineID''
%%% command to include the online ID value assigned to your paper by the
%%% submission management system. Replace '45678' with the value you were
%%% assigned.

\TOGonlineid{0399}

%%% 2. ``\TOGvolume'' and ``\TOGnumber''
%%% If you are preparing a preprint of your accepted paper, and your paper
%%% will be published in an issue of the ACM ``Transactions on Graphics''
%%% journal, replace the ``0'' values in the commands below with the correct
%%% volume and number values for that issue - you'll get them before your
%%% final paper is due.

%\TOGvolume{0}
%\TOGnumber{0}

%%% 3. ``TOGarticleDOI''
%%% The ``TOGarticleDOI'' command accepts the DOI information provided to you
%%% during production, and which makes up the URLs which identifies the ACM
%%% article page and direct PDF link in the ACM Digital Library.
%%% Replace ``1111111.2222222'' with the values you are given.

%\TOGarticleDOI{1111111.2222222}

%%% 4. ``\TOGprojectURL'', ``\TOGvideoURL'', ``\TOGdataURL'', ``\TOGcodeURL''
%%% If you would like to include links to personal repositories for auxiliary
%%% material related your research contribution, you may use one or more of
%%% these commands to define an appropriate URL. The ``\TOGlinkslist'' command
%%% found just before the first section of your document will add hyperlinked
%%% icons to your document, in addition to hyperlinked icons which point to
%%% the ACM Digital Library article page and the ACM Digital Library-held PDF.

%\TOGprojectURL{http://graphics.stanford.edu/projectNameHere}
%\TOGvideoURL{}
%\TOGdataURL{}
%\TOGcodeURL{}

\title{Probabilistic Color-by-Numbers:\\ Suggesting Pattern Colorizations Using Factor Graphs}

%%% The ``\author{}'' command takes the names and affiliations of each of the
%%% authors of your paper or abstract. The ``\thanks{}'' command takes the
%%% contact information for each author.
%%% For multiple authors, separate each author's information by the ``\and''
%%% command.

\and Thomas Funkhouser\thanks{e-mail: funk@cs.princeton.edu}\\ Princeton University %
\and Pat Hanrahan\footnotemark[1]\\ Stanford University}

%%% The ``pdfauthor'' command accepts the authors of the work,
%%% comma-delimited, and adds this information to the PDF metadata.

Our factor graph is trained on example patterns created by artists, and the top ten results after MMR diversification are shown. For comparison, on the right we show randomized colorings of each template. The lightness information shown to visualize the input pattern is not used.}
