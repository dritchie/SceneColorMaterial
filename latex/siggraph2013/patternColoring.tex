%%% The ``\documentclass'' command has one parameter, based on the kind of
%%% document you are preparing.
%%%
%%% [annual] - Technical paper accepted for presentation at the ACM SIGGRAPH 
%%%   or SIGGRAPH Asia annual conference.
%%% [sponsored] - Short or full-length technical paper accepted for 
%%%   presentation at an event sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH
%%%   (but not the annual conference Technical Papers program).
%%% [abstract] - A one-page abstract of your accepted content
%%%   (Technical Sketches, Posters, Emerging Technologies, etc.). 
%%%   Content greater than one page in length should use the "[sponsored]"
%%%   parameter.
%%% [preprint] - A preprint version of your final content.
%%% [review] - A technical paper submitted for review. Includes line
%%%   numbers and anonymization of author and affiliation information.

\documentclass[review]{acmsiggraph}

%%% If you are submitting your paper to one of our annual conferences - the 
%%% ACM SIGGRAPH conference held in North America, or the SIGGRAPH Asia 
%%% conference held in Southeast Asia - there are several commands you should 
%%% consider using in the preparation of your document.

%%% 1. ``\TOGonlineID''
%%% When you submit your paper for review, please use the ``\TOGonlineID''
%%% command to include the online ID value assigned to your paper by the
%%% submission management system. Replace '45678' with the value you were
%%% assigned.

\TOGonlineid{45678}

%%% 2. ``\TOGvolume'' and ``\TOGnumber''
%%% If you are preparing a preprint of your accepted paper, and your paper
%%% will be published in an issue of the ACM ``Transactions on Graphics''
%%% journal, replace the ``0'' values in the commands below with the correct
%%% volume and number values for that issue - you'll get them before your
%%% final paper is due.

%\TOGvolume{0}
%\TOGnumber{0}

%%% 3. ``TOGarticleDOI''
%%% The ``TOGarticleDOI'' command accepts the DOI information provided to you
%%% during production, and which makes up the URLs which identifies the ACM
%%% article page and direct PDF link in the ACM Digital Library.
%%% Replace ``1111111.2222222'' with the values you are given.

%\TOGarticleDOI{1111111.2222222}

%%% 4. ``\TOGprojectURL'', ``\TOGvideoURL'', ``\TOGdataURL'', ``\TOGcodeURL''
%%% If you would like to include links to personal repositories for auxiliary
%%% material related your research contribution, you may use one or more of
%%% these commands to define an appropriate URL. The ``\TOGlinkslist'' command
%%% found just before the first section of your document will add hyperlinked
%%% icons to your document, in addition to hyperlinked icons which point to
%%% the ACM Digital Library article page and the ACM Digital Library-held PDF.

%\TOGprojectURL{http://graphics.stanford.edu/projectNameHere}
%\TOGvideoURL{}
%\TOGdataURL{}
%\TOGcodeURL{}

\title{Amazing Paper Title that Grabs Your Attention}

%%% The ``\author{}'' command takes the names and affiliations of each of the
%%% authors of your paper or abstract. The ``\thanks{}'' command takes the
%%% contact information for each author.
%%% For multiple authors, separate each author's information by the ``\and''
%%% command.

\author{Matthew Fisher\thanks{e-mail: \{mdfisher, dritchie, msavva, hanrahan\}@stanford.edu}\\ Stanford University %
\and Daniel Ritchie\footnotemark[1]\\ Stanford University %
\and Manolis Savva\footnotemark[1]\\ Stanford University %
\and Thomas Funkhouser\thanks{e-mail: funk@cs.princeton.edu}\\ Princeton University %
\and Pat Hanrahan\footnotemark[1]\\ Stanford University}

%%% The ``pdfauthor'' command accepts the authors of the work,
%%% comma-delimited, and adds this information to the PDF metadata.

\pdfauthor{Matthew Fisher, Manolis Savva, Daniel Ritchie, Thomas Funkhouser, Pat Hanrahan}
