Hook (``colored patterns are everywhere...'')

Application domains (graphic design, web design, illustration, fashion, interior design, etc.)

Challenging for average person (participatory design)

Provide more suggestions even for the experienced designer

Precise problem statement (inputs/outputs/desired properties of outputs)

What makes this hard? why do we need new machinery?

Overivew of our approach (combine recent advances in color compatibility theory plus state-of-the art templated factor graphs to make this problem tractable...)

Extremely clear (bulleted list) statement of contributions

Tantalizing (but not overselling!) summary of cool results
