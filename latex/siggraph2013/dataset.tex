%TODO: Mention/Describe Colourlovers dataset somewhere. Briefly describe image preprocessing, and final renderings (probably this will be in the probabilistic model section?). 

To build a data-driven model, we require a source of training data. For the experiments in this paper, we used a dataset of colored patterns scraped from the Colourlovers website. The dataset contains 100 colored patterns for each of 82 artists---8200 patterns in total. The artists were chosen based on TODO.~\remark{Chosen based on popularity? Also, describe the image preprocessing we do (because we dont' have access to the original vector artwork?)}
