\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}

Summarize, restate contributions.

Discuss...stuff.

Some ideas for future work:
\begin{itemize}
 \item{Making it real-time: GPU implementation of parallel tempering (cite Merrell)}
 \item{Making it real-time: Hamiltonian MCMC via automatic differentiation (cite Wingate)}
 \item{Working with vector artwork, instead of bitmaps}
 \item{Beyond a fixed number of color groups: Transdimensional inference.}
 \item{`Soft' segments with `soft' membership in color groups? Useful for color blending, dealing with more sophisticated artwork}
 \item{Semantics: use the web to associate color distributions with labels, so that a user can label a region as 'skin' and we can respect that}
\end{itemize}
